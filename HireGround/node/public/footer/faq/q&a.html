                        be asked to enter your email address, after which you will receive instructions to create a new password. 

                        If you accidentally created a HireGround account with a typo in your email address or no longer have access 
                        to that email, unfortunately, it will not be possible to recover the password for that account. You will need to create a new account.
                        
                        When you click on a job listing posted by Indeed, you might be redirected to the employer's website 
                        where the job is listed. These external sites may have their own login or registration requirements, 
                        and you will not be able to sign in using your HireGround credentials.</p>

                        button next to the posting. You will then be asked to specify the reason for your concern, and our 
                        team will review the listing to ensure it complies with our guidelines.</p>

                    <p>We are thrilled that you've chosen HireGround for your job search! To apply for 
                        job listings on Indeed, you first need to visit our homepage. There, you will find 
                        two text fields labeled "What" and "Where." In the "What" field, you can enter keywords 
                        related to the type of job you're looking for, a company name, or an industry you’d like 
                        to work in. On the homepage, after browsing and finding a suitable job offer, click on "More..." 
                        to read the full job description. Once you've reviewed the position, click "Apply." If you're not 
                        logged in, you'll be prompted to either log in or sign up, and you will be redirected to the login 
                        or registration page, which will automatically fill in the required information. Alternatively, you 
                        can proceed without an account and manually enter your details each time. If you're not ready to apply, 
                        you can save the job posting to return to later. Please note that you must be logged in to save job listings.</p>

                <div class="content">
                    <p>Absolutely not! You can still apply without having an account, but you'll 
                        need to enter your information every time you wish to apply. However, 
                        creating an account is highly recommended as it will save you time and 
                        allow you to keep track of the jobs you are interested in.
